    "Having seen the dramatic impact of undetected mass balance errors, it is natural to ask how they can be detected. There are two general approaches.\n",

    "This approach has two challenges.\n",
    "First, the modeler must use annotations or other means to expose the chemical structure of species; this is not always available (especially\n",
    "for larger molecules that can be in many different chemical states of phosphorylation, methylation, etc.).\n",
    "A second problem is that it forces the modeler to write unnecessarly detailed reactions.\n",
    "For example, ``ATP2_MODEL`` fails this kind of mass balance checking because there is no accounting for the $\\gamma$ phosphate of ``ATP``.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to check for a condition that is a bit weaker than mass balance.\n",
