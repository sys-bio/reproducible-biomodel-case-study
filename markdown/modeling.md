What is biochemical network modeling?
=====================================

Chemical kinetics studies the factors that influence the rate of chemical reactions
e.g. concentration, temperature, light, catalysts, etc.

Chemical reaction networks are the framework for building all types of dynamical models

Types of Models:

: Genetic circuits
: Cell signaling pathways
: Metabolic networks

Types of biochemical network models:
: Agent-based
: Algebraic
: Boolean
: Constraint based
: echanistic differential equations models
: Statistical and machine learning methods
: Stochastic

Why do we perform network modeling?

: Understand subcellular processes
: Drive experimentation
: Make predictions about system behavior and the impacts of interferring with the system
: Design synthetic networks to control cellular processes
: Develop novel treatments for disease by predicting targets for pharmacological therapies, genetic modification, etc
: Provide a basis for larger multi-cellular models
